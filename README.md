## Introduction

This project is a recreation of the widely popular game **Wordle**, originally developed by **Josh Wardle** and released in October 2021. Wordle is a straightforward yet engaging word-guessing game where players must identify a hidden word within six tries. In this version, players can keep guessing new words to build a continuous streak. The game ends when the player fails to guess a word within the given number of attempts, breaking the streak.

## Wordle Rules

Guess the **WORDLE** in 6 tries.

Each guess must be a valid 5 letter word. Hit the enter button to submit. 

After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

- **GREEN** indicates the letter is in the word and in the correct spot.
- **YELLOW** indicates the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot. 
- **COLORLESS** indicates the letter is not in the word.
